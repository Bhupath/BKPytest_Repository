While importing the modules in python files.
  1. Import Third part modules
  2. Import Automation Custome Library modules.
  3. Import CommonUtils modules

Update the modules name along with version if any new third part modules applied in Automation Library at requirements.txt file.

Use QABiot.py console application for all execution.

* Pytest Execution Approaches.
=> pytest -v -s sanity
=> pytest -v -s <TestCaseFile>
=> pytest -v -s -k <string contain cases>

-k => Execute the string contain cases alone.
-m => Execute the marker cases alone.
-v => Verbose mode.
-s => To get the console output if stream try to print on the console.

* Code Quality Guide Lines.
1. Use pyline to validate teh codes it should be >=8
2. Peer review of python code, maintain the good quality with documentation as well.
3. Test Case Review to be done with Test Case Assignee and SME.
4. Module reference object should be in Capital Letter.
5. Method names should be in one word or snake case or pascal case.
6. Class names should be in camel cases (Upper Letter).
7. Varible or Literals can be Upper case or snake case.
8. Pytest test cases shoudl be start with test_ prefix.
9. In a method shouldn't allow more than 5 arguments in python if required suggested to use *args & **kwargs.
10. Don't use the time default fucntion in python recommende to use @retry decorator propert with tenacity module.
11. Don't use the python keywords as variables, method, class names.
12. No more logics shouldn't be write in Test Case function.
13. CommonUtils is an bussiness logics.
14. If decide to use fixture can be imported or maintain
